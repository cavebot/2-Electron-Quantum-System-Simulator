--*-- working with ifort compiler 
--*-- pgf90 compiler though compiler causes incorrect behaviour for k2e.f90




--*-- cs1ph(1s^2 --> nlel') with  en(nl) < 0 works o.k (seems to). 

** simplification the input subroutines. gradually abandoning OUT, DAT file

** summation for cs1ph++ over the 1-e target states might be better performed 
   and more rigorously if we sum over the target energies of the same symmetry.
   This because of the fxd boundary condition imposed for the inner electron, 
   thus resulting to different discretization for each partial wave l=0,1,2,.. 
   
** similar argument should hold for cs2ph++ as well. Or more generally for any 
   integration that involves energies of the inner electron (if its wf has been 
   generated with fxd bc).

--check-- : need to check phase convention for lsi = 0(singlet, phase=1), 1(triplet,phase=-1)
